  This is a small initiative by us to integrate all probability lovers and to create a platform for research and discussion open to all interested folks. Research proposals or problems in the field of probability or measure theory are welcome. Feel free to reach out to us as we are quite keen to learn more and work together as a team to reach a standpoint.
  
  We plan to arrange periodical seminars, paper presentations, and quizzes to stimulate and hone our outlook towards research. Further down the line, apart from being the holy grail of innovation in probabilistic thinking, we collectively aim to decipher unsolved conundrums in this field.
  
  Yeah, it indeed demands great exertion and is quite long-drawn but we sincerely hope for a lovely collaborative experience, as we are more interested in the journey rather than the destination! But what is the destination anyway? As a wise man once said, "A reasonable probability is the only certainty". 
  
  Cheers!
