We as a club, are fortunate enough to have Professor Arnab Chakraborty as one of our advisors and earnestly seek his guidance and supervision as we embark upon a journey of research in Statistical and Probabilistic avenues.

[Here](https://www.isical.ac.in/~arnabc/) is a link to Professor Chakraborty's home page, where he has showcased few among an array of his excellent works and teachings.

We as students have sincerely followed sir and his teachings (books, online YouTube videos, etc.) on varied topics of Probability and Statistics, some of which are as follows:

* Introduction to Probability Theory.

* Statistical Regularity (especially the interactive R-Simulations).

* Real Analysis.

* Linear Algebra & Linear Models.

* [Bayesian Computation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUARz1z_NKg&t=167s).
