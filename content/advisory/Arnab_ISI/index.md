An introduction of sir, would in no way be complete, as to us (the students), he is always an inspiration. Localizing his research interests to a certain field would be very difficult, as we have seen sir to master the art of teaching in almost each and every domain concerned to Mathematics, Statistics and Probability.

We as a club, are fortunate enough to have him as one of our advisors and earnestly seek his guidance and supervision as we embark upon a journey of research in Statistical and Probabilistic avenues.

[Here](https://www.isical.ac.in/~arnabc/) is a link to Professor Chakraborty's home page, where he has showcased few among an array of his excellent works and teachings.

(*PS: We would strongly and positively suggest the students of both mathematics as well as statistics to visit his homepage, as there are innumerable resources listed there, which would incredibly help towards building an iron-clad concept and base on both statistics and mathematics. Especially his books are of great help and guidance to the entire community of students, as sir gives a special touch of explaining things in Bengali.*)

We as students have sincerely followed sir and his teachings (books, online YouTube videos, etc.) on varied topics of Probability and Statistics, some of which are as follows:

* Introduction to Probability Theory.

* Statistical Regularity (especially the interactive R-Simulations).

* Real Analysis.

* Linear Algebra & Linear Models.

* [Bayesian Computation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUARz1z_NKg&t=167s).
