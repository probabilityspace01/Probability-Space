### Coincidence Statistics - A Non-Formal Approach to Probability!

As Maxwell puts it straight : "*The true logic of this world is in the calculus of probabilities*".  

When we talk literature, we mean literature only. No need to bring up bookish terms to define probability! To put this in a simpler way, think of the following scenario :

Suppose some dark night a policeman walks down a street, apparently deserted; but suddenly he hears a burglar alarm, looks across the street, and sees a jewellery store with a broken window. Then a gentleman wearing a mask comes crawling out through the broken window, carrying a bag which turns out to be full of expensive jewellery. The policeman doesnâ€™t hesitate at all in deciding that this
gentleman is dishonest. But by what reasoning process does he arrive at this conclusion? 

Ok, now you get it, right??  Probability is the science of this intuition or in more stricter terms deductive and plausible reasoning.

### Time to get formal now, how can we measure probability??

It was as late as the 16th and the 17th centuries that scientists could actually realize that chance (probability) can be measured.The Greeks even had a goddess of chance, **Tyche**. Several contemporary philosophers tried to give an empirical measurement of chance, but it appears that there was no quantitative theory of chance in these times.

Consider the analogous problem for another metric, say length. How would you measure length? Of course, it is silly to ask this question now, but this was a valid problem in the 16th century.

**You find a standard of equal length, apply it repeatedly and count**. The standard might be your foot,as you pace off a distance. One such approach was made in 1522, etched eternally in history books, known as the **"lawful rood"**.

The idea was to line up the feet of 16 people as they emerged from the church,as shown in the figure below :
