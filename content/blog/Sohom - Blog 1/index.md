### Coincidence Statistics - A Non-Formal Approach to Probability!

As Maxwell puts it straight : "*The true logic of this world is in the calculus of probabilities*".  

When we talk literature, we mean literature only. No need to bring up bookish terms to define probability! To put this in a simpler way, think of the following scenario :

Suppose some dark night a policeman walks down a street, apparently deserted; but suddenly he hears a burglar alarm, looks across the street, and sees a jewellery store with a broken window. Then a gentleman wearing a mask comes crawling out through the broken window, carrying a bag which turns out to be full of expensive jewellery. The policeman doesn’t hesitate at all in deciding that this
gentleman is dishonest. But by what reasoning process does he arrive at this conclusion? 

Ok, now you get it, right??  Probability is the science of this intuition or in more stricter terms deductive and plausible reasoning.

### Time to get formal now, how can we measure probability??

It was as late as the 16th and the 17th centuries that scientists could actually realize that chance (probability) can be measured.The Greeks even had a goddess of chance, **Tyche**. Several contemporary philosophers tried to give an empirical measurement of chance, but it appears that there was no quantitative theory of chance in these times.

Consider the analogous problem for another metric, say length. How would you measure length? Of course, it is silly to ask this question now, but this was a valid problem in the 16th century.

**You find a standard of equal length, apply it repeatedly and count**. The standard might be your foot,as you pace off a distance. One such approach was made in 1522, etched eternally in history books, known as the **"lawful rood"**.

The idea was to line up the feet of 16 people as they emerged from the church,as shown in the figure below :

The various folks have different foot lengths, but an implicit averaging effect was accepted by a group, even though the explicit term "average" was non-existent at that time.

However, there is an objection. There is a kind of circularity involved in the process. We are defining length, but we are already assuming that our standard remains the same length as we step off the distance.

Eventually, we refine our notion of length.Your foot may change length;so may the rod; so may the standard meter stick, at a fine enough precision.We refine the measurement of length using physics.The circularity is real, but it indicates a path for refinement rather than a fatal objection.

The same thing happens with probability. To measure probability, we first find or make **equally probable** cases and then count them.

We speak of probability only for observations that we contemplate being made in the future. By the “probability” of a particular outcome of an observation we mean our estimate for the most likely fraction of a number of repeated observations that will yield that particular outcome. If we imagine repeating an observation—such as looking at a freshly tossed coin — **N** times, and if we call ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?N_A) our estimate of the most likely number of our observations that will give some specified result A, say the result “heads,” then by ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathbb%7BP%7D%28A%29), the probability of observing A, we mean ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi%7B100%7D%20%5Csmall%20%5Cmathbb%7BP%7D%28A%29%3D%5Cfrac%7BN_A%7D%7BN%7D).
