excerpt: Can you split a ball into finitely many pieces, refit them, and produce two balls, both identical to the original one? With magic, yes. With math? Well, yes again. This is the famous Banach-Tarski theorem, a theorem so mind-boggling, that it has earned the nickname Banach-Tarski Paradox. The proof requires a little more than basic arguments involving countability and uncountability. We shall present the proof with pictures, We shall lightly touch upon the implication of this theorem on measure theory. Knowledge of measure theory is not a pre-requisite, though!

title: The Banach-Tarski Paradox

Have we ever wondered, why the axiom of **Countable Additivity** is so crucial while defining Probability Measure (or while extending any finite measure)?

In our opening webinar, we will hear about the unsung significance of **Countable Additivity** through one of the most perplexing paradox.
