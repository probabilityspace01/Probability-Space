### Coincidence Statistics - A Non-Formal Approach to Probability!

As Maxwell puts it straight : "*The true logic of this world is in the calculus of probabilities*".  

When we talk literature, we mean literature only. No need to bring up bookish terms to define probability! To put this in a simpler way, think of the following scenario :

Suppose some dark night a policeman walks down a street, apparently deserted; but suddenly he hears a burglar alarm, looks across the street, and sees a jewellery store with a broken window. Then a gentleman wearing a mask comes crawling out through the broken window, carrying a bag which turns out to be full of expensive jewellery. The policeman doesnâ€™t hesitate at all in deciding that this
gentleman is dishonest. But by what reasoning process does he arrive at this conclusion?
