We are happy to announce that Probability Space is starting a bimonthly magazine called  **Sigma Field**.

The structure of the magazine is as follows : 
* Probability
* Applied Sciences (Mathematical Statistics, Machine learning, Neural Networks, etc.)
* Problem Garden 

Almost all problems present here will be original problems contributed by the members. The solution to these problems will be uploaded on our Website.

**Those who want to contribute any article or problem , kindly send them to:[probabilityspace01@gmail.com](mailto:probabilityspace01@gmail.com)**

Note: There have been some articles written before on specific classical problems. All such articles will be put together in a single sub-section, in "Probability".

All the members are encouraged to write articles , not only on specific classical problems, but other aspects of probability or applied sciences as well. If needed/interested, one may go through the articles already published on our website, for that kindly visit the [Sigma Field Section](https://probability-space.netlify.app/blog/).

One person can write more than one article. It is a must to present your references as well, in the article.

For any further updates please free to connect with us via mail, LinkedIn or Facebook, the links to which you can find @ our website.
